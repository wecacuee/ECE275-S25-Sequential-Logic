\section{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time allowed is $\infty$ minutes.
  \item In order to minimize distraction to your fellow students, you may not leave
  during the last 10 minutes of the examination.
  \item The examination is closed-book. One $8\times11$ in two-sided cheatsheet is allowed.
  \item Non-programmable calculators are permitted.
  \item The maximum number of marks is 160, as indicated; the midterm examination
  amounts 10\% toward the final grade.
  \item Please use a pen or heavy pencil to ensure legibility. Colored
    pens/pencils are recommended for K-map grouping.
  \item Please show your work; where appropriate, marks will be awarded for proper and well-reasoned explanations.
  \item If you are behind on grades, you may submit the solutions to this on brightspace before the Dec 13th exam for (makeup) homework grades. If you are already ahead, then these grades won't push you beyond hundred in homework grades.

\begin{prob}
  A sequential circuit has two inputs and two outputs. The inputs ($X_1$ and $X_0$ ) represent a 2-bit binary number, N. If the present value of N is greater than the previous value, then $Z_1$ is 1. If the present value of N is less than the previous value, then $Z_2$ is 1. \textbf{Otherwise}, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are 0. When the first pair of inputs is received, there is no previous value of N, so we cannot determine whether the present N is greater than or less than the previous value; therefore, the “otherwise” category applies.

Find a Mealy state table for the circuit (minimum number of states, including starting state, is five) (30 marks).

  by student employees.The carts and packages are various sizes and shapes.The students
  are paid according to the carts used. There are five carts and the pay for their use is\\
  Cart C1: \$2\\
  Cart C2: \$1\\

  Figure~\ref{fig:seven-seg-display} shows the notation for a BCD to 7-segment
display and Table~\ref{tab:seven-segment-tt} shows the corresponding truth
table. The inputs corresponding to the missing rows in the truth table should be
considered as don't care.
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item implement segment ``a'' using an 8:1 mux and no other logic gate, (10 marks)
   \item implement segment ``a'' using a 4:1 mux and one other gate, (10 marks)
   \item implement segment ``f'' with 4:1 mux and no other logic gate. Assume
     inputs are available in both uncomplemented and complemented form. (Hint:
     There are (${}^4C_2 = 6$) possible pairs of control inputs: ($w_3, w_2$), ($w_2, w_1$),
     ($w_1,w_0$), ($w_0, w_3$), ($w_0, w_2$), ($w_1, w_3$). There are 6 don't
     care conditions. With two control inputs of the multiplexer and one input,
     you can represent an expression with up to 4-SOP-terms of size
     three-literals or less. You might the arrive at the answer sooner, if you
     try to write the minimal SOP expression first and find the two inputs that
     occur most often in all the terms. Those two inputs are most likely to be the
     chosen pair of control inputs.) (10 marks)
