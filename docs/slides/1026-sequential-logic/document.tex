\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Understand timing diagrams, gate delays and critical path
  \item Design Hazard-free two level circuits
  \item Building blocks of sequential circuits

\section{Why do we need sequential circuits?}

\begin{example}
  Think about this problem: Design an occupancy counter that depends on a
  sensor $S$ at the class door. The sensor is triggered every time a person passes
  through the door. The counter can be reset to zero with a reset button. Assume
  we only need up to two bit counter $C_1C_0$. Draw a truth table for this
  circuit. Do you have requisite knowledge for designing this circuit? Can this
  circuit be designed without a memory element?

\section{How to create memory element from circuits}

Two types of memory
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Volatile memory. For example, RAM, CPU registers.
  \item Non-volatile memory. For example, SSD, Flash drives. (Not covered in this course)
    \begin{enumerate}

        source: \url{allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/introduction-to-dram-dynamic-random-access-memory/}}

      Access memory~\cite[Appendix~B.64]{stephen2022fundamentals}\\

  each rising edge of CLK, Q toggles to the complement of its previous value. Draw

  edge of the clock, it updates the output, Q. If J and K are both 0, Q retains its old
  value. If only J is 1, Q becomes 1. If only K is 1, Q becomes 0. If both J and K are 1,
  Q becomes the opposite of its present state.

\section{Finite State Machines~\cite[Sec~3.4]{harris2022digital}}\footnote{These
  notes will not fit on your note sheet.}

\begin{example}
  Design an occupancy counter that depends on a
  sensor $S$ at the class door. The sensor is triggered every time a person passes
  through the door. Assume that the counter starts at zero. Assume
  we only need up to two bit counter $C_1C_0$. Draw a state table for this
  circuit.
\end{example}

\begin{prob}
  A divide-by-N counter has one output and no inputs. The output Y is HIGH for
  one clock cycle out of every N. In other words, the output divides the frequency
  of the clock by N. The waveform for a divide-by-3 counter is shown here:\\
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./fig/fig.38a-divide-by-3-counter.png}\\
  Sketch circuit designs for such a counter
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
  Design a 3-bit counter which counts in the sequence:
  001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 100, (repeat) 001, ...
\end{prob}

\begin{example}
  Design an odd-even counter for an single bit input. The output of this circuit
  should be 1 if the number of 1s to the input have been odd so far and 0
  otherwise.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Sequence detectors]
  A sequential circuit has one input and one output. The output becomes 1 and
  remain 1 thereafter when at least two 0's and at least two 1's have occurred
  as inputs regardless of the order of 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider the problem of inventing a controller for a traffic light at a busy
  intersection on campus. There are two traffic
  sensors, $T_A$ and $T_B$ , on Academic Ave. and Bravado Blvd., respectively.
  Each sensor indicates TRUE if students are present and FALSE if the
  street is empty. There are two traffic lights, $L_A$ and $L_B$, to control
  traffic. Each light receives digital inputs specifying whether it should be
  green, yellow, or red.
  When the system is reset, the lights are green on Academic Ave. and red on Bravado Blvd.
  As long as traffic is present on Academic Ave., the lights do not change. When there
  is no longer traffic on Academic Ave., the light on Academic Ave.
  becomes yellow for 5 seconds before it turns red and Bravado Blvd.’s light
  turns green. Similarly, the Bravado Blvd. light remains green as long as
  traffic is present on the boulevard, then turns yellow and eventually red.

    boolean expression.
  \item Assign binary encodings to each of the output and redraw the output
    table. Design a minimal SOP boolean expression for the outputs.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}


\begin{prob}
  Design a circuit for a 2x2 pixel resolution pong game, where the ball can only
  occupy 4 possible pixels and a single paddle occupies another 2 pixels. The
  ball bounces of the paddle when the paddle is in the correct row. To keep it
  interesting, the ball takes a different path from the source path. Track the
  score with a single bit counter.
\end{prob}
